Angular boilerplate
====================

Uses a combination of angular generator for Grunt config and angular seed for lighter library use

Does not contain Bootstrap

Does contain Sass/Compass

Uses Jasmine, Karma and Phantom JS for test running


Make sure you have grunt and grunt-cli installed

Run NPM install

Run grunt serve to view the project in a browser

Live reload in place so changes in scss and js src will automatically run grunt commands to update browser view
